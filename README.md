# Impact Measurement Case Study (SROI-lite) — Community Meals Support

## Goal
Build a simplified Social Return on Investment (SROI-lite) model to demonstrate impact measurement skills:
- research synthesis (assumptions + evidence notes)
- data input validation (quality checks)
- transparent modelling (deadweight, attribution)
- sensitivity analysis (conservative/base/optimistic)
- concise stakeholder-ready reporting

## Outputs
- Excel SROI-lite model: `model/SROI_Model.xlsx`
- Assumptions table: `data/assumptions.csv`
- Summary report: `report/Impact_Case_Study.md` (export to PDF later)

## Programme (example)
A community meals programme providing weekly food packs to households experiencing food insecurity.

## Logic model
**Inputs → Activities → Outputs → Outcomes**
- Inputs: funding, volunteers, food supplies, logistics
- Activities: collect food, prepare packs, distribute weekly
- Outputs: packs delivered, households served
- Outcomes: improved food access, reduced financial stress, improved wellbeing
