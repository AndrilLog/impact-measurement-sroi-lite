# Impact Measurement Case Study (SROI-lite) — Community Meals Support

## Goal
Build a simplified Social Return on Investment (SROI-lite) model to demonstrate impact measurement skills:
- research synthesis (assumptions + evidence notes)
- data input validation (quality checks)
- transparent modelling (deadweight, attribution)
- sensitivity analysis (conservative/base/optimistic)
- concise stakeholder-ready reporting

## Outputs
- Excel SROI-lite model: `model/SROI_Model.xlsx`
- Assumptions table: `data/assumptions.csv`
- Summary report: `report/Impact_Case_Study.md` (export to PDF later)

## Programme (example)
A community meals programme providing weekly food packs to households experiencing food insecurity.

## Logic model
**Inputs → Activities → Outputs → Outcomes**
- Inputs: funding, volunteers, food supplies, logistics
- Activities: collect food, prepare packs, distribute weekly
- Outputs: packs delivered, households served
- Outcomes: improved food access, reduced financial stress, improved wellbeing

## Results (Illustrative)
SROI range using scenario sensitivity:
- Conservative: 0.53496
- Base: 0.8112
- Optimistic: 1.16776

# Impact Measurement Case Study (SROI-lite) — Community Meals Support

A practical, transparent **impact measurement case study** demonstrating a simplified **Social Return on Investment (SROI-lite)** approach. Built to showcase research synthesis, data quality, and stakeholder-ready reporting.

> **Important:** This is an **illustrative model** based on stated assumptions. It is **not** an evaluation of a specific organisation.

## Why this project
Impact measurement is often hard because outcomes are complex and data quality varies. This project demonstrates a structured approach to:
- translate programme activity into measurable outcomes,
- apply realism adjustments to avoid over-claiming impact,
- produce a clear, repeatable model that can be improved with real client data.

---

## What I built
- **SROI-lite Excel model** with transparent assumptions and calculations  
  `model/SROI_Model.xlsx`
- **Assumptions table** used as model inputs  
  `data/assumptions.csv`
- **Stakeholder-ready summary report** (1–2 pages)  
  `report/Impact_Case_Study.md` (exportable to PDF)

## Programme (example used)
A community meals programme providing weekly food packs to households experiencing food insecurity, aiming to improve food access and reduce financial stress.

---

## Logic model
**Inputs → Activities → Outputs → Outcomes**
- **Inputs:** funding, volunteers, food supplies, logistics  
- **Activities:** collect food, prepare packs, distribute weekly  
- **Outputs:** packs delivered, households served  
- **Outcomes (modelled):** improved food security, reduced financial stress, improved wellbeing, reduced crisis support usage  

---

## Method (SROI-lite)
1. **Define outcomes** and map the programme logic.
2. **Estimate outcomes** using an assumptions table:
   - participants served
   - outcome rates
   - value proxies (NZD)
   - duration (years)
3. Apply realism adjustments:
   - **Deadweight:** what would have happened anyway
   - **Attribution:** how much of the outcome is due to other factors
4. **Quality checks** (input validation) to reduce errors and improve reliability.
5. **Sensitivity analysis** using conservative/base/optimistic scenarios.

---

## Results (illustrative)
SROI = **Total Adjusted Benefits / Programme Cost**

Scenario range:
- **Conservative:** **0.53496**
- **Base:** **0.81120**
- **Optimistic:** **1.16776**

Interpretation: under the current assumptions, the model estimates approximately **$0.53–$1.17 of social value for every $1 invested**, with a base estimate of **$0.81 per $1**.

---

## Data quality and transparency
This project prioritises clarity and auditability:
- inputs are separated from calculations (assumptions CSV + Excel model),
- assumptions are explicit and editable,
- realism adjustments are visible and explainable,
- scenario testing highlights uncertainty rather than hiding it.

---

## Limitations
- Outcome rates and value proxies are illustrative and require validation using real programme measurement.
- Attribution and deadweight should ideally be informed by stakeholder workshops and stronger evidence grading.
- A more robust evaluation would include baseline and follow-up data and/or safe data linkage where appropriate.

---

## How I would strengthen this with real client data
- Collect baseline and follow-up outcomes (survey and/or validated scales).
- Use locally relevant, evidence-backed value proxies and clearly cite them.
- Improve attribution estimates via stakeholder mapping and workshops.
- Add outcome confidence scoring and documentation to align with standardised delivery.
