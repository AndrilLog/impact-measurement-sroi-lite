# Impact Measurement Case Study (SROI-lite) — Community Meals Support

## Purpose
This case study demonstrates a simplified Social Return on Investment (SROI-lite) approach to impact measurement. It is designed to show transparent modelling, clear assumptions, data quality checks, and stakeholder-ready reporting. This is an illustrative case study and not an evaluation of a specific organisation.

## Programme Summary
A community meals programme providing weekly food packs to households experiencing food insecurity, with the aim of improving food access and reducing financial stress.

## Logic Model
**Inputs → Activities → Outputs → Outcomes**
- Inputs: funding, volunteers, food supplies, logistics
- Activities: collect food, prepare packs, distribute weekly
- Outputs: packs delivered, households served
- Outcomes: improved food security, reduced financial stress, improved wellbeing, reduced crisis support usage

## Method (SROI-lite)
1. Defined a simple logic model and identified key outcomes.
2. Created an assumptions table to estimate:
   - number of participants,
   - outcome rates (participation-to-outcome conversion),
   - value proxies (NZD),
   - duration (years).
3. Applied realism adjustments commonly used in SROI-style thinking:
   - **Deadweight** (what would have happened anyway)
   - **Attribution** (how much is due to other factors)
4. Implemented model input checks (QA/QC) to reduce input errors.
5. Tested uncertainty using scenario-based sensitivity analysis.

## Key Assumptions (Illustrative)
- Participants: 300 households/participants
- Time horizon: 1 year
- Outcomes are valued using simple NZD proxies for demonstration purposes.
- Deadweight and attribution are applied as percentage reductions to avoid overstating benefits.

## Results (Illustrative)
SROI Ratio = Total Adjusted Benefits / Programme Cost

- **Conservative SROI:** 0.53496
- **Base SROI:** 0.81120
- **Optimistic SROI:** 1.16776

Interpretation: under the current assumptions, the model estimates approximately **$0.53 to $1.17 of social value for every $1 invested**, with a base estimate of **$0.81 per $1**.

## Data Quality Controls
The model includes basic checks to confirm:
- percentage inputs are within valid ranges (0–1),
- programme cost is positive,
- outcome rates are valid,
- totals calculate correctly.

## Limitations
- Outcome rates and value proxies are illustrative and require validation through real programme measurement.
- Attribution and deadweight estimates should be informed through stakeholder mapping and stronger evidence.
- A more robust approach would incorporate baseline and follow-up outcomes, plus stronger evidence grading.

## Next Steps (How to strengthen with real client data)
- Collect baseline and follow-up participant outcomes (survey or validated scales).
- Use verified value proxies aligned to local context.
- Improve attribution estimates through stakeholder workshops.
- Explore safe data linkage options (where appropriate) to validate service-use outcomes.
